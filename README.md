Adele is an open source repository of publically available design systems and pattern libraries. 

Creation of a design system and pattern library is a long, if not infinite, process that requires a loooot of decisions. *Some* of these decisions are about the structure and technology. All are complex and have a huge impact on the future of design and development in our organizations. No wonder that we, design system folks, battle imposter syndrom on daily basis üò±. 

This is exactly why Adele is here. With dozens (hopefully soon hundreds!) of design systems and pattern libraries analyzed, Adele serves as a reference point for all these decisions that we have to make every day. Check what others do, learn from it and make better decisions about your own system! üöÄ

# Mission

Adele is on the mission to collect *all* the data about publically available design systems and pattern libraries and present it to the community in a human (website) and computer (JSON) readable formats.

# How to use?

There are three ways to use Adele:

1. Browse data on [Adele's website](https://adele.now.sh). Take advantage of multiple filters and get to the right systems in no time ‚ö°Ô∏è.
2. Browse data in [individual JSON files](https://github.com/marcintreder/adele/tree/master/src/data/systems) ü§ñ.
3. Browse data in [a common JSON file](https://github.com/marcintreder/adele/blob/master/src/data/data.JSON). *Why?* Good question. Adele is an open source project, so you're free to take the data and use it in your own projects (contributing back to the design systems community - highly encouraged üëè).

# Why Adele?

No. Adele - Design Systems Repository, has not been named after Adele - the singer. This is a tribute to one of the most important computer scientists focused on graphic user interfaces, design patterns and object-oriented programming - Adele Goldeberg.
Adele Goldberg worked at XEROX PARC in the 70s and managed the System Concepts Laboratory where together with Alan Kay and others she developed Smalltalk-80 - object-oriented, dynamically typed, programming language that was meant to power the "human-computer symbiosis".

Needlss to say, SmallTalk also pioneered many concepts important to all modern design systems. Object in Smalltalk were easily transferable between applications and customizable. Smalltalk also served as the foundation of PARC's work on graphically based user interfaces (many GUI concepts has been developed by Adele Goldberg and her group!).

Thank you Adele!
